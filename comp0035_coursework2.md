# Coursework 2

Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.

## Requirements definition and analysis

The term 'requirements' is used in the broader sense, user stories and/or use cases may be used.

Requirements help us to achieve project's objectives and meet stakeholders' needs.

There are 2 types of requirements:
- *Functional requirements* (specify what the system should do through explanation of functions, feature or behaviour)
- *Non-functional requirements* (specify how the system should operate)

### Requirements identification methods

There are many ways to elicit the requirements for the project:

1. Interview
2. Workshop
3. Survey/ Questionnaire
4. Interface analysis
5. Focus group
6. Observation or ethnography
7. Brainstorming
8. Prototyping
9. Analysing documentation

For the purpose of this project, I decided to use brainstorming, interface analysis and prototyping techniques.

### Requirement specification method

Methodology used is agile, which is why user stories to identify requirements is useful.

### Prioritisation method

MoSCoW technique has been chosen for prioritisation of requirements

As part of this technique all requirements are distributed into the following categories:

- Must have: critical requirements that are essential for success.
- Should have: as important as "Must have", but not time-sensitive.
- Could have: it would be good to add these requirements, but not essential.
- Won't have for now: their value is relatively low, which is why they could considered later.

### Documented and prioritised requirements

Link to the full list of documented and prioritised requirements.

Table: requirement, conditions of satisfaction, functional/non-functional, prioritisation.

Requirement| Conditions of satisfaction | Functional/non-functional | Prioritisation |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
1. Create a new user account | ... | Functional | Must have |
2. Login page | ... | Functional | Must have |
3. Logout button | ... | Functional | Must have |
4. Show main data analytics on the dashboard | ... | Non-functional | Must have |
5. Give user a chance to change the parameters for shown data | ... | Functional | Should have |
6. The application should work with recent OS versions| ... | Non-functional | Must have |
7. System should respond to any change in parameters within 1-2 seconds| ... | Non-functional | Should have |
8. System should be able to send an email to the user's email account with the analysis | ... | Functional | Could have |

## Design

### Structure and flow of the interface

### Relational database design

### Application structure

## Testing

### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests

The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results

Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)

Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please
provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.

## Weekly progress reports

### Report 1

What I did in the last week:

- Started putting up the requirements by using user stories.
- Went through the material for requirements and application design.

What I plan to do in the next week:

- Finalise the table for requirements.
- Work on application and interface design.

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):

- No issues, but I am not sure whether everything should be written text or we should add some diagrams too?
