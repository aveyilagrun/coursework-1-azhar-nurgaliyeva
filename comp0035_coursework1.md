## Data set
Transport - "Public transport journeys by type of transport".

Project idea: explore how public transport use in London has changed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

## Selection of project methodology
### Methodology (or combination) selected
Methodology - Data Driven Scrum

### Selection criteria and justification of selection
Criteria - experience of the team in particular methods.

The selected methodology is Data Driven Scrum, which is the combination of Scrum and Kanban board methods. Both methods are agile frameworks, which is why they are particularly useful for data science projects. This methodology has been chosen as I have an experience of working with it from my summer work experience.

Pros: easier to accommodate tasks with uncertain time duration, efficient iterations, transparency, no unnecessary meetings.

Cons: same template for backlog tasks required to avoid confusion, iteration review is happening randomly, what about priority tasks (?)

## Definition of the business need
### Problem definition
There are many different types of public transportation in London. Trends in the usage of public transport change due to the certain events such as road closures, construction works and so on. In 2020 and 2021, there were a lot of disruption of TfL because of coronavirus pandemic. These changes led to the transition of popularity for public transport journeys by type of transport. Due to an increased demand for transport and Brexit shortages, there is now a problem of overcrowding and a lack of drivers.

### Target audience
TfL analysts and workers.

### Questions to be answered using the dataset
Trends in the usage of transport types in London can help TfL analysts to come up with better project plans and approaches.

### Suggested web app
Web app can show graphs such as changes in the popularity of certain journey types.

## Weekly progress reports

### Report 1
What I did in the last week:
- Got assigned a data set regarding the changes in journey types in London. 
- Went through the list of methodologies and chose the most suitable one for my data set. 
- Looked at the data set to understand the types of data there.

What I plan to do in the next week:
- Work on the problem statement
- Identify tha target audience

Issues blocking my progress (state 'None' if there are no issues):
